JavaScript/Firebase Todo List
===================================


### Run
This project requires that you have the Firebase Tools installed. Instructions for doing so can be found here: 
https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/  Follow the instructions to install and log in.

Next, you'll need to create a Firebase project to associate it with in your console: https://console.firebase.google.com/  After creating the project, click the "Database" tab under "Develop", and then choose "Use Cloud Firestore."

When that is done, move into the project directory on your command line associate it with your project.
`$ firebase use`
You may then run it locally with 
`$ firebase serve`
Or deploy it with
`$ firebase deploy`
